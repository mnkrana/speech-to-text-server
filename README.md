This project takes an audio file as an input and returns transcribed text via google apis.

Using Fast APIs so you can deploy it to lambda functions if you like or run it locally.

You can compare between wav and flac files, and see which one fits your usecase.

I recommend using flac as it is smaller file than wav and gets faster response from google apis.
